In 2020, Solopova began her PhD at Freie Universit√§t Berlin and defended her dr.rer.nat with "summa cum laude" in July 2024 with her topic being "Hybrid AI systems for Automated Content Moderation and analysis".  During her PhD, she worked in the BMBF-funded PetraKIP project on an application for student teachers with automated feedback on their reflective essays, and as a senior researcher also was part of coordination & development of BMBF-funded noFake project working on CORRECTIV,Faktenforum - a fact-checking platform for citizen journalists. She authored a number of publications on social media moderation and analysis, on topics such as hate speech, propaganda, and shitstorm detection.
