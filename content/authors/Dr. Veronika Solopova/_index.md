Dr.-Ing. Lisa Raithel completed her undergraduate studies in Computational Linguistics at Potsdam University (B.Sc.). She then pursued her master's degree in Cognitive Systems at Potsdam University, specializing in deep learning techniques for natural language processing. During her studies, Lisa gained experience in both academia and industry, including positions at the Leibniz-Centre General Linguistics (ZAS) and Yukka Lab AG. She conducted her master's thesis research at DFKI GmbH in Berlin, successfully completing it in 2019 (M.Sc.).

After obtaining her master's degree, Lisa worked as a software engineer at Giance (now Unicepta) before transitioning back to academia for a double degree PhD program (cotutelle) at Technische Universität Berlin and Université Paris-Saclay under the supervision of Prof. Sebastian Möller and Pierre Zweigenbaum, Directeur de Recherche CNRS. Her doctoral research focused on cross-lingual information extraction for the detection of adverse drug reactions. During that time, Lisa spent one year at LISN in Orsay, France (2021 - 2022) and three months at the Social Computing Lab at NAIST in Nara, Japan (2023). In February 2024, she successfully defended her thesis at TU Berlin.

Lisa is currently working as a post-doctoral researcher at TU Berlin / BIFOLD and is affiliated with the Speech- & Language Technology group of DFKI GmbH as a guest researcher. Her research interests continue to center on natural language processing and its applications in the healthcare domain.
