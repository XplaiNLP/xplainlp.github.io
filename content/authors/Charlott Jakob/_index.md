Charlott Jakob received her bachelor's degree in Industrial Engineering from the Karlsruhe Institute of Technology. She then pursued further studies in Industrial Engineering, majoring in Information & Communication Systems, at TU Berlin, where she completed her master’s thesis in the Quality and Usability Lab. Since 2023, she is employed as a research assistant in the XplaiNLP group in the QUL, exploring the interaction between NLP systems and humans towards responsible and ethical AI usage. Her focus is on uncovering discrimination due to algorithmic biases and examining machines’ transparency by applying explainability techniques.
