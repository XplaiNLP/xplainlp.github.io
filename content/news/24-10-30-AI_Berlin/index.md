At a time when artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming increasingly integrated into everyday life, a key question arises: What role does AI play in the spread of disinformation, and how can we counter this threat? In particular, narrative disinformation amplified by AI systems has the potential to deepen social divisions and undermine trust in democratic processes. Dr. Vera Schmitt and her team at the TU Berlin are researching innovative approaches to identify and combat AI-based disinformation. In this interview, we want to learn more about the current challenges, promising strategies, and how research, politics, and society can work together to preserve the integrity of our information landscape.
