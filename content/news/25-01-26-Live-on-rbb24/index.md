Democracy thrives on facts, not fiction. That’s why I’m excited to be part of "Fakten statt Fiktion – Gemeinsam gegen Desinformation," a crucial panel discussion tackling one of the defining challenges of our time: the spread of misinformation and disinformation in the digital age. 

💡 What’s at stake?
The fight against disinformation is not just about fact-checking false claims—it’s about building resilience in society, ensuring journalistic integrity, and empowering people with media literacy tools to navigate an increasingly complex information landscape.

 Key topics include:
🔹 The evolving tactics of disinformation networks
🔹 AI's role in both spreading and countering falsehoods
🔹 The responsibility of media, tech platforms, and policymakers
🔹 Strategies for strengthening media competence and democratic resilience

Moritz Demmig from rbb showcased several deepfakes, and we discussed how we analyze them using an AI-human collaborative system that we are currently developing as part of our joint news-polygraph project (funded by BMBF). 

Dr. David Biesinger, editor-in chief of rbb gave also a statement during the panel discussion explaining the current mistakes and challenges the journalistic investigations about of Stefan Gelbhaar. 

What are your thoughts? 
During the panel discussion, we explored the concept of human immaturity and our capacity to critically assess false and misleading information. Do we still have the motivation to seek enlightenment through facts and engage in self-reflection to overcome our self-imposed immaturity, as Immanuel Kant once described? Or have deepfakes and generative AI become so convincing that this pursuit is no longer possible?
