Announcing Our New Research Group Lead Vera Schmitt for Disinformation Narrative Detection and eXplainable AI (xAI)

<!--more-->

We are thrilled to announce that Vera Schmitt will be stepping into the role of Research Group Lead, leading the XplaiNLP group (https://lnkd.in/dYY_J5Ps) which she build up over the past years. She aquired 1.4 Mio € from the BMBF to build up and extend the group. The aquired research group project named "VeraXtract" (https://lnkd.in/eMjdxwdq) started on 1. of September and will intensify their work concerning disinformation narrative detection and eXplainable AI. This is a pivotal moment for the XplaiNLP group as we continue to expand our research capabilities and tackle some of the most pressing challenges in the digital landscape.

As the leader of this research group, Vera Schmitt will be guiding a talented team of researchers and collaborating with partners across academia, industry, and government to push the boundaries of what’s possible in this field. The work done under her leadership will have far-reaching implications, helping to protect the integrity of information in our increasingly digital world.
Please join us in congratulating Vera Schmitt on this well-deserved role. We look forward to the groundbreaking work that lies ahead and are confident that her leadership will drive significant advancements in disinformation detection and xAI.

Stay tuned for new PhD positions being opened soon in her group!
