🎉 This week, I had the incredible opportunity to present my first research paper at the CLEF 2024 Conference. The conference was held in Grenoble, but I skipped the airport lines and presented from Berlin instead. No lost luggage, but I definitely missed out on some French pastries and mountain views!

🎤 I spoke about our team's paper titled "Towards a Computational Framework for Distinguishing Critical and Conspiratorial Texts by Elaborating on the Context and Argumentation with LLMs" that is part of the PAN shared task on Oppositional Thinking Analysis.

🙏🏼 A huge thank you to my co-authors Premtim Sahitaj, Salar Mohtaj, Sebastian Möller, and PI Vera Schmitt from the Quality and Usability Lab at TU Berlin and DFKI. A special thanks also to Paolo Rosso from the University of Valencia for making it possible for me to present our work!

👩🏻‍💻There is still much work ahead in improving LLMs for disinformation detection, and I am super excited to be part of it!
