We were inspired by the keynotes delivered by Verena Rieser, Isabelle Augenstein, Andreas Vlachos, Barbara Plank, Jean-RÃ©mi King, and Luke Zettlemoyer, each of them offered valuable insights into the current and future directions of NLP, responsible AI, and how language is processed in the human brain.

ðŸš€ Our group members Jing Yang, Veronika Solopova, Nils Feldhus, Max Upravitelev, Premtim S., Ariana Sahitaj, and Qianli Wang presented research multiple papers on a wide range of topics. Moreover, our group learned, discussed, and grew together with the global NLP community.
