In July 2025, eight members of the XplaiNLP research group had the opportunity to attend the Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL 2025) in Vienna. What began with great anticipation turned into a week filled with inspiring discussions, cutting-edge research insights, and valuable connection.

We were inspired by the keynotes delivered by Verena Rieser, Isabelle Augenstein, Andreas Vlachos, Barbara Plank, Jean-RÃ©mi King, and Luke Zettlemoyer, each of them offered valuable insights into the current and future directions of NLP, responsible AI, and how language is processed in the human brain.

Dr. Jing Yang, Dr. Veronika Solopova, Dr. Nils Feldhus, Max Upravitelev, Premtim and Ariana Sahitaj, Qianli Wang and the research group lead Vera Schmitt presented multiple papers on a wide range of topics. Our group presented research on explainability methods for NLP models, approaches to disinformation narrative detection, and evaluation frameworks for model faithfulness. We particularly valued the vibrant discussions around interpretability, robustness, and human-centered evaluation, topics that lie at the core of our research agenda.

Inspired by the discussions at ACL, our team is now working on a follow-up study on narrative shifts in multimodal disinformation and expanding our evaluation frameworks for explainable AI. Weâ€™re also deepening collaborations with international partners we connected with in Vienna.
