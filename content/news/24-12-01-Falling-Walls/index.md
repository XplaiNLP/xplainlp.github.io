🚀 Thrilled to share that we presented the news-polygraph project at the Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin, in collaboration with the DFKI, as part of the AI Night during Berlin Science Week (https://lnkd.in/e2T_G9Yy)! 🌐✨

As the largest research initiative in Germany focused on tackling multimodal misinformation and disinformation, news-polygraph addresses one of today’s most pressing challenges. By integrating cutting-edge deep learning approaches with a strong emphasis on explainability and transparency, our platform empowers users to identify and understand false and misleading content.

Together with Tim Polzehl and his team from the Deutsches Forschungszentrum für Künstliche Intelligenz (DFKI) and other partners, the XplaiNLP Group at TU Berlin is developing innovative solutions for multimodal disinformation detection.

The summit was a great experience! We had inspiring discussions with Richard Socher from You.com, Jack Thoms from BIFOLD - Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data, Matthias Bethge from Tübingen AI Center, and Susanne C. from Technische Universität Berlin among others.

We enjoyed engaging with the community and are already looking forward to participating again next year!
