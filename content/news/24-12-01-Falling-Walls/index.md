üöÄ Thrilled to share that we presented the news-polygraph project at the Falling Walls Science Summit in Berlin, in collaboration with the DFKI, as part of the AI Night during Berlin Science Week (https://lnkd.in/e2T_G9Yy)! üåê‚ú®

As the largest research initiative in Germany focused on tackling multimodal misinformation and disinformation, news-polygraph addresses one of today‚Äôs most pressing challenges. By integrating cutting-edge deep learning approaches with a strong emphasis on explainability and transparency, our platform empowers users to identify and understand false and misleading content.

Together with Tim Polzehl and his team from the Deutsches Forschungszentrum f√ºr K√ºnstliche Intelligenz (DFKI) and other partners, the XplaiNLP Group at TU Berlin is developing innovative solutions for multimodal disinformation detection.

The summit was a great experience! We had inspiring discussions with Richard Socher from You.com, Jack Thoms from BIFOLD - Berlin Institute for the Foundations of Learning and Data, Matthias Bethge from T√ºbingen AI Center, and Susanne C. from Technische Universit√§t Berlin among others.

We enjoyed engaging with the community and are already looking forward to participating again next year!
