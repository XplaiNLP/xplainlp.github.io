abstract: |
    The perception of speech quality is crucial for effective telecommunication, yet it is a multifaceted construct influenced by various perceptual dimensions. This paper presents an in-depth analysis of the interplay between overall speech quality, measured via Mean Opinion Score (MOS), and its contributing perceptual dimensions: noisiness, discontinuity, coloration, and loudness. Utilizing two distinct datasets—one live, encompassing telephone and Skype calls with real-life distortions, and one simulated, with controlled speech degradations—we apply Partial Least Squares Structural Equation Modelling (PLS-SEM) to ascertain the impact of each perceptual dimension on the overall MOS. Our results demonstrate that loudness is the most significant predictor of MOS in the live dataset, while discontinuity takes precedence in the simulated dataset. The variance in the influence of these dimensions between the datasets underscores the necessity of context-specific quality assessments in transmitted speech, challenging the suitability of a generalized approach. Our findings are instrumental for future developments in the field of speech quality assessment, providing insights that could lead to more nuanced and context-sensitive evaluation tools.
