abstract: |
    This chapter synthesizes empirical findings from prior chapters into a structured model of privacy valuation. Using structural equation modeling, it identifies relationships between privacy-related and general influencing factors and their predictive power on WTP and WTA. The chapter provides a holistic view of privacy economics, integrating theoretical and empirical insights.
