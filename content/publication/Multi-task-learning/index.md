abstract: |
  Automated text readability assessment is the process of assigning a number to the level of difficulty of a piece of text
  automatically. Machine learning and natural language processing techniques made it possible to measure the readability and
  complexity of the fast-growing textual content on the web. In this paper, we proposed a multi-task learning approach to
  predict the readability of German text based on pre-trained models. The proposed multi-task model has been trained on three
  tasks: text complexity, understandability, and lexical difficulty assessment. The results show a significant improvement in the
  model’s performance in the multi-task learning setting compared to single-task learning, where each model has been trained
  separately for each task
