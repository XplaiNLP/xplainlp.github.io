abstract: With the rise of Large Generative AI Models (LGAIMs), disinformation online has become more concerning than ever before. Within the super-election year 2024, the influence of mis-and disinformation can severely influence public opinion. To combat the increasing amount of disinformation online, humans need to be supported by AI-based tools to increase the effectiveness of detecting false content. This paper examines the critical intersection of the AI Act with the deployment of LGAIMs for disinformation detection and the implications from research, deployer, and the user’s perspective. The utilization of LGAIMs for disinformation detection falls under the high-risk category defined in the AI Act, leading to several obligations that need to be followed after the enforcement of the AI Act. Among others, the obligations include risk management, transparency, and human oversight which pose the challenge of finding adequate technical interpretations. Furthermore, the paper articulates the necessity for clear guidelines and standards that enable the effective, ethical, and legally compliant use of AI. The paper contributes to the discourse on balancing technological advancement with ethical and legal imperatives, advocating for a collaborative approach to utilizing LGAIMs in safeguarding information integrity and fostering trust in digital ecosystems..
