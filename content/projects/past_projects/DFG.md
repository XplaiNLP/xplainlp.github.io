### Project Description

The aim of this project is to assess how much individuals would pay for protecting their personal data, such as location information in contrast to how much they would request when selling the information to different data requestors. The monetary assessment of privacy is analysed in relation to the individualâ€™s privacy concern, privacy literacy and privacy awareness to understand influencing factors for the monetary assessment of personalised information.

### Expected Outcomes
- Assessment of existing methods for the monetary valuation of personal data 
- Better understanding of influencing and moderating factors, such as privacy concern, privacy literacy and personality traits 
- Analysis of the structural relation of the different influencing and moderating factors
