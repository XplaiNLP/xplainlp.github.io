### Project Overview
The European Union's 17 Sustainable Development Goals are already deeply embedded in business and society. However, it has been difficult to measure the contributions of the various actors. The ateSDG project is working to take a closer look at organizations from Berlin and Brandenburg by categorizing published texts using Natural Language Processing. In addition to classification, another focus of the project is model explanation. The selection and visualization of "explainability features" allows people to understand and validate the actions of the model. The goal of the project is an interactive dashboard that automatically assigns SDGs when text is entered and illustrates the underlying text modules and facts.
