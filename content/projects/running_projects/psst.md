### Project Overview
The rapid growth of smart speech technology, much of which is operated by companies outside the European Union, has transformed how consumers access information and applications by using just their voices. Recently, however, we’ve learned that devices like smart speakers and smartwatches may expose users to privacy risks. Both service providers and hackers can capture not only what users say but also sensitive information hidden in their voices (like health information), all without the users knowing or agreeing to it.

To tackle these risks, new privacy-protecting smart speech technologies could help create business models that comply with EU laws like the GDPR and the AI Act. The PSST joint doctoral training network will train new researchers to develop these vital technologies using advanced deep learning methods. PSST will work on removing identifying features in speech, improving interactions between devices and cloud services, and creating new ways to assess privacy threats.

The PSST consortium includes top research labs in speech processing, privacy, and usability, as well as several innovative companies. This academic-industrial partnership will offer a robust training program that equips doctoral researchers with skills in speech processing, machine learning, and a thorough understanding of privacy issues and technologies. Together, PSST partners and researchers will not only offer a unique, user-focused perspective on smart speech technologies but also encourage innovative business models for responsible and sustainable privacy-aware technologies in the EU.

PSST is a joint doctoral training programme, a consortium of 7 European universities and 11 industrial partners, funded by Horizon Europe Marie Skłodowska-Curie Action, the European Union’s flagship funding programme for doctoral training.

The project is organized into three teams: Defence, Attack, and Utility. The teams will engage in a friendly competition for the iterative advancement of privacy-preserving speech technology. Each team has four doctoral researchers working on distinct [projects](https://doctoralnetwork.projectsites.aalto.fi/news/research-projects-and-teams-in-psst/).
