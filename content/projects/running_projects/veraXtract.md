### Project Overview
The VeraXtract project is funded by the BMBF to establish and expand the XplaiNLP research group. The thematic focus of the project is on the extraction and detection of disinformation narratives and the development of approaches in the field of eXplainable AI.

Within the project, PhD students will focus on different topics:
- Knowledge Base: development of a vector-based database consisting of disinformation narratives and provenance analysis/similarity search,

- Narrative Extraction: development of LLM-based methods and approaches for disinformation narrative recognition and extraction

- xAI: Development of AI-based explanations such as Chain-of-Thought-Prompting and Mechanistic Interpretability to communicate results to different user groups

### Goals
In the long term, the knowledge and experience gained from VeraXtract should help to strengthen society's resilience to disinformation. The solutions developed also have potential for use in content moderation in social media and could serve as the basis for new standards in the fight against disinformation in the future.

In VeraXtract, we want to create an overview and go into less depth. This overview is necessary to provide better information about disinformation and also to be able to more quickly assign statements to existing disinformation narratives. The results of the VeraXtract project will be integrated into a publicly accessible platform.
