### Project Overview
The primary aim of [VERANDA](https://www.tu.berlin/qu/forschung/laufende-vergangene-projekte/laufende-projekte/veranda) is to explore and promote informational self-determination in the context of personal and sensitive medical data, especially among stigmatized groups. This includes advancing essential medical diagnostics, such as cancer detection and clinical-psychological care, which has seen increased demand during the COVID-19 pandemic. The project is closely tied to the provision of personal data for research purposes, highlighting the importance of effective risk-opportunity communication with patients and the public. By examining the conditions under which patients are willing to share their data during online consultations, the project seeks to develop communication strategies that enhance users' understanding of relevant data protection technologies.
