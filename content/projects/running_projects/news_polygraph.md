### Project Overview
News-Polygraph is a collaborative research project working on a comprehensive, multimodal technology platform for analyzing and detecting disinformation. By combining (AI) analysis methods for text, audio, image and video as well as the integration of crowd support, our project aims to support journalists and the media in effectively combating disinformation.

The News-Polygraph research alliance is the biggest research project funded by the Federal Ministry of Education and Research (BMBF) as part of the “RUBIN – Regional Entrepreneurial Alliances for Innovation” funding program. A total of nine partners from Berlin, Brandenburg and Thuringia, including institutions from science, media, technology and business, are working together on effective solutions to integrate AI as intelligent decision support in the information verification workflow.

News-Polygraph helps to strengthen trust in the media and information by supporting the integrity of journalistic work and protecting the public from misleading content.
